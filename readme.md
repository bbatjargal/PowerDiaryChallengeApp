# PowerDiaryChallengeApp
A console application to view chat history at varying levels of time-based aggregation.

# Design principles used

- **SOLID Principles**
  - **Single-responsibility (SRP)** - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
  - **Open-closed (OCP)** - Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution (LSP)** - Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without changing the behavior of the application.
  - **Interface segregation (ISP)** - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
 - **Dependency inversion (DIP)** - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

# Area of improvements

**In terms of design:**

- To segregate MessageHistoryManager class into different aggregate classes.
- To add async.
- To add events and delegate.
- To add multi-threads.

**In terms of data access components:**

- Adds ORM functionality. (EF, Dapper, or ADO.NET).
- Read from files.

**In terms of functionalities:**

- Add different views like Yearly, Monthly, Daily, and Minutely or Hourly for a particular day.

**In terms of UI clients:**

- Adds a single-page application (SPA) UI using front-end frameworks like React UI or mobile.
